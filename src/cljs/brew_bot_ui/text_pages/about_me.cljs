    "At its core, beer is comprised of 4-5 primary ingredients: grain, hops, yeast, water, and possibly malt extract. "
    "Recipes are collections of these various ingredients, usually put together with a purpose. "
    "For example, a brewer may pick a 3:1 ratio of 2-row to Caramel/Crystal malt to get an appropriate amount of sugar released for fermentation, while also picking up the lovely toffee-like flavor of the darker malt. "
    "Likewise, hops are chosen for the wide array of flavors they can provide: ranging from pine to citrus, all on a wide spectrum of bitterness."]

   [:p
    "Conventional wisdom and zymurgy, the branch of science concerned with fermentation, have guided the selection of ingredients for years. "
    "However, recent advances in data science have changed the game, and recipes are often adjusted by computer to account for crop variations. "
    "Brewing technology has greatly democratized the study of chemistry, and kits and chemicals are available to homebrewers to control even the finest details of their water. "
    "Brew-bot pushes this line further, and generates recipes of its own."]
